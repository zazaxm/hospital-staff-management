## Security Notes

- This is a demonstration system with basic security
- Passwords are stored in plain text (not recommended for production)
- Email configuration should be properly secured in production
- Consider implementing proper session management for production use

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port Already in Use**
   - Change the port in `server.js` (line 8)
   - Or kill the process using the port

2. **Email Not Sending**
   - Check email configuration in `server.js`
   - Ensure Gmail app password is correct
   - Check firewall/network settings

3. **Data Not Persisting**
   - Ensure the application has write permissions in the directory
   - Check that JSON files are not corrupted

### Development Mode
Run the server in development mode with auto-restart:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Support
